### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 

Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was the start of my journey into becoming a programmer. Despite being simple, it taught me how a small program would work. It also taught me how to work in pairs.

* Lab 11, Part 2 

Lab 11, part 2 was another one of my favorite labs since it taught me more about how to create random number generators. I found out that objects allow you to organize code more efficiently in order to make sure that managing the properties of your program is easier on the programmer. I even learned how to create a small game from this.

* Lab 12, part 2 

Lab 12, part 2 was also one of my favorites because it teaches us a bit on how a gif works. Not only does it help me practice creating random number generators, but it teaches me about library functions. I also found this lab a bit more challenging than the others, which will allow me to also learn the capabilities of what I can and canâ€™t do on my own.
