### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because it was the start of my journey into becoming a programmer. Despite being simple, it taught me how a small program would work, along with how to print out messages using the std::cout command. It also taught me how to work in pairs and also what to expect when doing so.

* Lab 11, Part 2

Lab 11, part 2 was another one of my favorite labs since it taught me more how to create random number generators. It also taught me that objects allow you to organize code more efficiently in order to make sure that managing the properties of your program is easier on the programmer. I even learned how to create a small game from this, which was another reason that this lab is a favorite of mine.

* Lab 12, part 2

Lab 12, part 2 was also one of my favorites because it teaches us a bit on how a gif works. Not only does it help me practice creating random number generators, but it teaches me about library functions. I also found this lab a bit more challenging than the others, which allowed me to learn more about myself, mainly the capabilities of what I can and canâ€™t do on my own, making it easier for me to realize when I need help and when I should ask for it.
